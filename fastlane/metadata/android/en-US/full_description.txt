Forked from <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/app.olauncher/">Olauncher</a> because original version is cluttered

- Removed clutter, like ads and links
- You can rename apps in the app-drawer _(Renaming apps on the home screen is already supported. Just long-click on an app on the home screen and start typing)_
- We have added a lot more options for gestures on the home screen:
    - Gestures are now:
        - Swiping up, down, left, right
        - Clicking on the clock
        - Clicking on the Date
    - Possible actions now include:
        - Open specified app
        - Locking the screen
        - Opening the notification drawer
        - Opening the quick settings
- You can also position the clock independently of the home apps
- Change alignment of apps in app-drawer
- Change font size
- Removed internet permission. You never know what an app developer wants to know about you.


Olauncher CF uses the following permissions:

- `android.permission.EXPAND_STATUS_BAR`
	- Allows an application to expand or collapse the status bar.
- `android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`
	- Allows query of any normal app on the device, regardless of manifest declarations. Used to show the apps list.
- `android.alarm.permission.SET_ALARM`
	- Allows an application to broadcast an Intent to set an alarm for the user. Used to open the default alarm app if no other clock app is set in the settings.
- `android.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES`
	- Required for issuing the request to remove packages. This does not allow the app to remove apps directly; this only gives the permission to issue the request.
